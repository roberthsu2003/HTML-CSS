        <dt>Linotype</dt>
        <dd>Line-casting allowed type to be selected, used, then recirculated
        into the machine automatically. This advance increased the speed of typesetting and printing dramatically.</dd>

        <dt>Photocomposition</dt>
        <dd>Typefaces are stored on film then projected onto photo-sensitive paper. Lenses adjust the size of the type.</dd>

        <dt>Digital type</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Digital typefaces store the outline of the font shape in a format such as Postscript. The outline may be scaled to any size for output.</p>
            <p>Postscript emerged as a standard due to its support of graphics and its early support on the Macintosh computer and Apple laser printer.</p>

        <p>Our alphabet hasn't changed in eons; there isn't much latitude in what a designer can do with the individual letters.</p>
        <p>Much like a piece of classical music, the score is written down. It's not something that is tampered with, and yet, each conductor interprets that score differently. There is tension in the interpretation.</p>
